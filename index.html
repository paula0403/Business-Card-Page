    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>I am Paulina. I am a huge fan of handmade: knitting and sewing. This way I can relax and let my creativity run
        free. I get inspiration from cartoons and movies. I have
        completed the A.12 tailoring course.More of my projects
        and inspiration can be found on the blog.
        Apart from handmade, my passion is traveling in southern Europe. I love extreme mountain tourism, especially in
        the Polish Tatras, for example Eagle Path. I'm crazy about Spain and spanish culture and language.
        I have been learning web programming for several months: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. I would like to change my
        career path in the future.
        I created the design of this website using the following technologies:

          <p>Thick woolen sweater for bitter frosts. In the pattern I used nups (balls) and a honeycomb motif. In
            general, the sweater is quite rich in various motifs. I do not hide that it was laborious and
            time-consuming. I made the front and back in the same way, the only difference is the presence of the balls,
            which would not hurt the back;). The sleeves also feature a honeycomb pattern. To liven up the whole piece
            of knitting the head of the sleeve has been made with a lighter yarn. The whole thing, of course, is high in
            wool (70% and 50%). In fact, the mere sight of it makes me warm. <br /><button class="more">more</button>

          <p>A sweater made in the form of a circle. Usually it is called the turner, but mine reminds me more of the
            wheel because of its stiffness. It is made of a mixture of wool and cashmere with a bright cotton-wool
            finish to illuminate the whole. I like the pattern very much and I'm about to make a mini and summer cotton
            version. <br /><button class="more">more</button></p>

          <p>Romantic set. The semicircle skirt is made of thick dove-colored neoprene. It is very light and
            comfortable. It has a metal zipper sewn in at the back, which gives it a bit of a vanguard character. For
            the skirt I have completed a sweater / dress crochet with a shell pattern. I used plum Yarn Art. Kid Mohair
            with a lot of mohair to make it. It is very light, stylish and soft to the touch. It looks great with an
            elegant shirt. <br /><button class="more">more</button></p>

          <p>A christening set for a boy. It consists of a fluffy jacket with a hood made of shiny polyamide yarn. Soft
            bamboo sweater has front elements designed on the basis of semicircles. A "baseball" cap made of acrylic
            yarn with a golden thread. The last element are thick cotton sneakers that give the set a casual character.
            The whole is complemented by navy blue and blue accessories: buttons, bows, laces.<br /><button

          <p>The airy scarf made just on request. It is intended to serve as an undersuit in case of cold weather. I
            used a yarn with a lot of mohair in a light gray color. Finally, the dimensions were 130cmx60cm, so the size
            to "wrap around" is ok. The pattern consists of leaf motifs, which makes it incredibly light. The scarf is
            very warm and airy at the same time.<br /><button class="more">more</button></p>
